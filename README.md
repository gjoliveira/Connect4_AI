# Connect4_AI
Connect4 implementation with AI adversial and search  algorithms



_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________-


This project is a digital rendition of the Connect 4 game, where two players take turns dropping colored(red or yellow) discs. into a 6x7 grid. The goal is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertival, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.

This implementarion offers several modes of play, including Player vs. Player, Player vs. CPU, and CPU vs. CPU, with various difficulty levels provided by different algorithms like A*, Monte Carlo's Tree Search, and Negamax for the CPU logic.
